# EmailCollectMembership
ðŸ“¬ Project Idea Description You're building a simple project that automatically sends email reminders to your friends to contribute to a shared YouTube membership. This can be scheduled to run on a specific day each month (e.g., 1st or 25th) and send friendly, customized emails reminding each member to transfer their share of the subscription cost.
